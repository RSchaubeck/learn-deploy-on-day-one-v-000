            <div class="description-holder">
              <p>Ben was born and raised in San Diego where he was active in the tech scene during the mid and late 1990s.
              He co-founded the Toorcon Computer Security Conference, a San Diego BSD Users Group and a local computer
            security meetup. In 2001 he shifted focus and moved to New York City where he first received a B.A. in Psychology
          and then later was ordained a rabbi.</p>
            <p>As a rabbi he served communities in Boston, Denver and New York. He wrote numerous articles for publications such
              as <em>Time Magazine, The Boston Globe, The Denver Post, MyJewishLearning.com, The Huffington Post</em> and others. Ben has
              published two books, the first a compilation of tweets on the Torah. He was selected as a rabbi without borders
              in 2010 and served on the boards of national and international organizations.</p>
              <p>After nearly 10 years in communal service, Ben has returned to the tech sector as a student at the Flatiron School.
                He is looking forward to immersing in coding and in the art and science of brainstorming, designing, creating and implementing
                new programs and projects. He lives in the Bronx with his wife and children.</p>
